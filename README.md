### What I learned

This was a challenging project in terms of aligning images and content of the page in a way, that would lead to the best outcome for viewers with different screen sizes. While working through this project I came across a problem of making images responsive, as I wanted to include all of the images inside my HTML file and avoid manipulating them with media queries. I have found two great solutions to this problem: first, the <picture> element or <img srcset=""> syntax; second, the object-fit property.

Also, this project helped me understand more about mix-blend-mode CSS property.

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about making images responsive in CSS.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Responsive Image Tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-responsive-image-tutorial/) - This helped me understand what I should NOT do while working on responsive images;
- [A Guide to the Responsive Images Syntax in HTML](https://css-tricks.com/a-guide-to-the-responsive-images-syntax-in-html/#using-srcset) - This is an amazing article about the <picture> element and the <img srcset=""> syntax.
